This repository contains several Machine Learning related projects done during school terms.

All the projects here either have naive implementation of basic algorithms such as perceptron, gradient decent and SVM or make direct call to existing implementation of state of the art algorithms implemented by [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/).

Those projects are done rather bluntly, avoid referring to them at all cost. :o
